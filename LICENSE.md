=======================================================================

1. Intent and Scope
   - The purpose of this Addendum is to make explicit that while the underlying work is available for non-commercial research, educational, and defensive use under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, any use that meaningfully facilitates malicious, illegal, unauthorized, or harmful activity is strictly prohibited.

2. Prohibited Uses (Non-Exhaustive)
   You SHALL NOT use the Materials, or derivatives thereof, for any of the following purposes:

   a) Unauthorized or malicious access: Activities intended to gain unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or data.  
   b) Credential theft or misuse: Harvesting, storing, or distributing credentials, secrets, or authentication tokens for malicious use.  
   c) Persistence and privilege abuse: Implementing or distributing techniques or tools that create unauthorized persistence or escalate privileges on systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.  
   d) Exfiltration or distribution of sensitive data: Exfiltrating or publishing sensitive or personal data belonging to others.  
   e) Disruption or destruction: Causing denial-of-service, modifying boot configuration to prevent normal operation, or other destructive actions.  
   f) Circumvention of security: Assisting in bypassing security controls such as UAC, endpoint protection, or tamper-protection in an unauthorized context.  
   g) Distribution of operational payloads or C2: Publishing or distributing runnable samples, operational command-and-control endpoints, or step-by-step deployment instructions that enable execution on production systems.  

3. Sanitization Requirement
   - If you redistribute derivatives or analysis based on the Materials, you MUST remove or sanitize any executable payloads, live C2 endpoints, unredacted sensitive data, or protocol details that would enable someone to operationally deploy offensive capabilities.
   - Label redistributed artifacts clearly as "sanitized" or "non-operational" when applicable.

4. Responsible Handling of Live Samples
   - If you receive or encounter live malicious samples or infrastructure, you agree to handle them responsibly: do not publish or distribute them publicly and report them to the impacted parties, a CERT, or an appropriate abuse channel.

5. Enforcement and Remedies
   - Violation of this Addendum is a breach of the license and may result in revocation of the license rights granted by CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and subject the violator to legal remedies under applicable law.

6. Attribution & Notices
   - When sharing derivatives, include an attribution statement that identifies the original repository and indicates that the work has been sanitized if applicable. Example attribution:
